# CS50FinalProject
My final project for CS50.
This project currently only deploys in the CS50 ide. I am working on developing it as a standalone application.

This application is designed to create a choose your own adventure style story where the choices are made en masse by the 
users. Each week the admin posts a new part of the story, ending with a series of four options. The users then log in each 
week, read the story and respond by choosing one of the options. The admin then monitors the users votes as the week
progresses and finally after a week they write their new story part based on the most popular choice from the users.

Additional functionality allows the users to look back over previous story entries and their own story option choices. The 
admin account has further functionality. They have the ability to post new story entries (limited to one per week), post 
new story parts and options, edit story entries and view all registered users.
